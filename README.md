## Description

### Choose your favorite anime

When browsing TikTok, I saw a topic called who are you going to marry filter. It is very interesting that people choose the person they want to marry the most by constantly choosing one from the other.

So I did a similar one, by constantly picking the anime you thought was the best.

The anime included so far are only the ones I've watched, and I think they're pretty good. So the data is incomplete. If you have any anime that you think is good, please feel free to submit it, and I will add it to the database as soon as possible.

Finally, here's for some fun, everyone has a few favorite animes in their hearts.

**Don't take the rankings too seriously.**
