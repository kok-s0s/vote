  "why-1": "The idea for me to do this came from watching some「 #who'd you rather 」videos on TikTok, and it was fun to pick and choose who you would most like to marry.",
  "why-2": "As a「 2.5-dimensional 」, I will re-enact one and make a Web App to select the best anime you think. Of course, this is purely a job, and the ranking should not be taken seriously.",
  "why-3": "The animations currently included are all what I have watched, and may not be very complete. If you have recommended animations, please file an issue under the repo, and I will add them as soon as possible."
